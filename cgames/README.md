# Benchmarking DRL Algorithm(Discrete) on Classic Games

<p align="center"><img src="../images/cgames.gif" width="100%"></p>

We used classic games from OpenAI Gym and Vizdoom as our main testbed to study the behaviour of the following algorithms:

 1. DQN — Deep Q-learning
 2. DDQN — Dueling DQN
 3. Rainbow
 4. Reinforce
 5. A2C — Advantage Actor Critic
 6. PPO — Proximal Policy Optimization

We compare the results of launch of six algorithms on games from two perspectives: Traning and Testing. Same Deep Neural Network is used for all algorithms. Click on particular game for more information.
